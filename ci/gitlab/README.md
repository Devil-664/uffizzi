# Use Uffizzi with GitLab CI

You can configure Uffizzi to create, update, and delete on-demand Preview Environments with the GitLab CI [Environment Action](https://gitlab.com/uffizzi/environment-action). This action will execute the [Uffizzi CLI](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_cli) on a GitLab runner, which then opens a connection to the Uffizzi API.
